This is a group project I done in my undergraduate. We designed a flight ticket booking system and implemented it using android studio. Users can enter query to search for air tickets in our database. 

Techniques stacks involved:

### Programing language for backend: Java.

### Interface: Android studio

### User's data collection: Firebase





Here are some screen shoot of the programs.
